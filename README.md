## Purpose

Term One Second Assignment as a part of the Coder Academy Fast Track Bootcamp. The purpose of this assignment was to plan, design and develop a portfolio site for potential employers. The purpose of the site itself is to showcase my individual personality and skills as a developer, as well as showcase a knowledge of HTML and CSS, web design and prototyping, and website deployment.

## Functionality / Features

The site is a relatively minimal design and has four main pages: Home, Projects, Blog, and Contact. The projects and blog pages contain links to individual project and blog post pages.

### Home Page

The home page is designed to give the user a quick overview over the whole site. It contains a landing section, an about me section with skills and a personal bio, a sample of three projects from the projects page, and a footer that contains contact details.

### Projects

The projects page goes in depth into all the personal projects I have included. There is currently a total of four projects included, but this will be updated in the future. However, the home page will continue to only have three projects that are showcased as a preview. There are links to view each project within this page.

### Individual Project Page

The individual project page has a detailed run through over the project tech stack, the functionality/features of the project itself as well as screenshots and images. Placeholder images are being used currently. The background colour of these individual pages are different to the main site pages to make them stand out. Links to GitHub repositories are also available on these pages.

### Blog

The blog page mirrors the projects page in that it displays a list of all blog posts on the site. These blogs are just sample blogs at the moment, and contain placeholder images and text.

### Individual Blog Page

Again, these individual blog pages are similar in design to the individual project pages, but contain placeholder text to mimic a real blog.

### Contact

While contact details are available on the footer component on each page of the site, there is a dedicated contact page which contains a message and better access to contact details.

### Dropdown Menu

The desktop version of the site has a standard navbar fixed to the top of the page, but this collapses into a dropdown menu for the mobile version. This menu contains links to all main pages of the site.

### Animations

Animations are handled by custom JavaScript and third party modules. ScrollReveal.js is used to handle animation when elements appear in the DOM (scrolling down and having headings fade in), and anime.js is being used for the bulk of the dropdown menu animation. Custom JavaScript is also used to toggle classes to facilitate the dropdown menu functionality, as well as inverting the navbar colours when scrolling down to the dark mobile footer.

### Different Versions

In accordance with the marking guidelines, two variations of the website have been made and pushed on separate branches. To see these, run either command in the root of the project:

```
$ git checkout version-2
```

or:

```
$ git checkout version-3
```
